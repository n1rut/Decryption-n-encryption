There is a teremok in the field. A mouse-norushka runs past. I saw the teremok, stopped and asked:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower? No one responds. The mouse entered the teremok and began to live there.
The frog asks for a teremk
A frog-croaker jumped up to the terem and asked:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower?
- I'm a mouse-norushka! And who are you?
- And I'm a croaking frog.
- Come live with me! The frog jumped into the teremok. They began to live together.
The bunny asks for a teremok
A bunny-runner runs by. He stopped and asked:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower?
- I, the mouse-norushka!
- I, the frog-croaker!
- And who are you?
- And I'm a bunny-run.
- Come live with us! The hare is jumping into the teremok! The three of them began to live.
The fox-sister asks for a teremok
A fox-sister is walking by. She knocked on the window and asked:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower?
- I'm a mouse-norushka.
- I, the frog-croaker.
- I'm a bunny-run.
- And who are you?
- And I'm a fox-sister.
- Come live with us! The fox climbed into the teremok. The four of them began to live together.
The wolf asks for a teremok
A top-gray side came running, looked in the door and asked:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower?
- I'm a mouse-norushka.
- I, the frog-croaker.
- I'm a bunny-run.
- I, the fox-sister.
- And who are you?
- And I'm a top-gray side.
- Come live with us!
The wolf got into the teremok. The five of them began to live. Here they live in a teremka, they sing songs.
Bear and teremok
Suddenly there is a club-footed bear. The bear saw the teremok, heard the songs, stopped and roared at the top of his lungs:
- Terem-teremok! Who lives in the tower?
- I'm a mouse-norushka.
- I, the frog-croaker.
- I'm a bunny-run.
- I, the fox-sister.
- I, the top-gray side.
- And who are you?
- And I'm a club-footed bear.
- Come live with us!
The bear climbed into the teremok. Climbed, climbed, climbed - couldn't get in and says:
- And I'd rather live on your roof.
- Yes, you will crush us.
- No, I won't crush it.
- Well, get in! The bear climbed onto the roof and just sat down - fuck! - the teremok collapsed.
The bear brok the teremok
The teremok cracked, fell sideways and collapsed all over. Barely had time to jump out of it a mouse-norushka, a frog-croak, a bunny-run, a fox-sister, a top-gray side - all safe and sound.
They began to carry logs, saw boards - to build a new teremok.
They built it better than the previous one!
